We recursively traverse through the tree and when we reach the leaf node we return the node's value itself to the parent value. So we are returning 0 when the node is null. We can get max path if we can include or exclude the root node. So for each node we maintain max(left,right)i.e discarding root max(including root with either left or right) including root and getting max of left or right. If we have all negative nodes we consider the smallest valued node among them.
