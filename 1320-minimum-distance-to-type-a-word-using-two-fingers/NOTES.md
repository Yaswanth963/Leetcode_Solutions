Initially we can place our fingers at any position. So we start placing our two fingers at different positions and so recursive calls to obtain minimum.

For each character we can find its row and col number by using val/6, val%6. For each call we either reach current character from finger1 or from finger2. We get the results of both and store the minimum.
